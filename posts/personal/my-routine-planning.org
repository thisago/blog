* Intro
:PROPERTIES:
:END:
I was thinking through words earlier on what's wrong on my routine planning this morning and I realized it can be a great manner to start my public [[https://swyx.io/digital-garden-tos][digital garden â†—]].

So below is my planning.


* The Plan
** Intention :summary:
The goal is aggregate all I need to build a good routine:
- Values
- Expected Overcomes
- Notion of Time Blocking


** Keep In Mind
*** Expected Overcomes & Values
- Organized Mind :: Stop worrying on "what's next".
- Make Life Pleasant :: The "want more" taste in the end of the day.
- Time Is Short :: Wasting time isn't a option.
- Procrastination Is A Sign :: Reduce the tasks load by interpolating with light and enjoyable tasks.
- Reduce Decision Making :: Need to think on what to do next wastes your energy.
- Eat The Frog From The Morning :: The chaos should be taken on the morning, where you're full of energy.

*** Considerations
Since the start time of the day changes accordingly my needs and desires, I'll be time-agnostic.

The below visualizations considers:
- We need 8h of rest.
- We have a available time-span of src_calc[:exports results]{24-8} {{{results(=16=)}}} hours.
- I'll allocate at least 6h of work.
- I need pauses on work to avoid procrastination.

*** Static Inflexibility
- Mon-Fri 8:30AM-9:00AM :: Point Daily
- Sun-Sat 4PM-5PM :: Daily call with my best friend
- Sat 10AM-12PM :: Call on friends' studies group

*** Known Issues
- Extend the refections due distractions (such audiobooks or social interactions).
- Dive into hype and ignore the other tasks.
- Procrastinate on work due lack of breaks.
- Lack of the habit to say *NO*, overloading myself at work.
  + New tasks aren't a break from your previous responsibility.
- Overthinking on changing tasks.
- Checking agenda and daily plan is currently a struggle. It should be easy as =Alt+Tab=.


** Ideas
- The Pomodoro break could be:
  - Reading a book.
  - Hearing a audiobook, taking it from refections.
  - Learning a new thing.
  - Talk with others via messaging.


** Scratching The Plan
This is my personal planning, use it as inspiration!
*** Tasks Overview
1. ~REQUI~ Wake up and prepare
   - Exit bedroom
   - Caffeine
   - Eat
   - Exercises

3. =IDEAL= Technical study on other areas
   - Bible
   - Psychology
4. ~REQUI~ Work @8h30min
5. =IDEAL= Lunch @12h

*** Idealizations
- Finish the work before the call with my friend.
- Be able to do the morning tasks.
- Take the last bath to break thirdwork tension.

*** Theories
- If I skip day idealization, that "saved time" will be spent on a existential crisis session. Keep the mind healthy is not a optional thing.
- Instead of considering work blocks as thirdwork-only, I can do my work tasks on there, taking advantage of the inertia already obtained from the coding process.
