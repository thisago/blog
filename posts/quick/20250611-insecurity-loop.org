#+title: Insecurity Loop
#+filetags: insecurity
#+include: _base.org

If you get insecure from your own insecurity, you'll fail.

Same for:
- Get anxious of being anxious.
- Fear your own fears.
- Get stressed of being stressed.

It's like microphony, it gets loud and loud... And then, you fuck with something.[fn:: See first rule's sub-chapter /Malfunction/ at /12 Rules for Life/ from Jordan Peterson]

Don't let yourself enter the Loop from Hell.[fn:: See chapter 1 of book /The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck/ from Mark Manson]
