Insecurities... We should love and take care of them. They're allies for our journey.

* Humility
Do you ever asked what in the children makes them learn so quick, improve so fast and grow so consistently in a short period of time?

Why after adolescence we start to degenerate and ignore important things?

I think it could be our ego, our arrogance growing and suffocating the humility.

And a reliable form to feed the humility, is with insecurities.


* Should I Fear?
Insecurities aren't fear. They indeed bring fear, but it can be handled.

*You shouldn't fear.*

Mistakes is a learning and should not be blamed, except if done intentionally.

The real failure is only when we stop trying.

At this context and on my perspective, insecurity is more about understanding the largeness of things you don't know, it's about seeing where you really stand. Where you really are at.

It's highly tied with humility, in this perspective.

* Do Not Throw Them Away!
In the journey of life, the climb makes our past insecurities small and insignificant, and throwing them away feels a easy thing to do.

As they make us feel bad in the present, we ask: Why I'm bringing this with me? Why not annihilate this discomfort?

Unfortunately we're naturally ungrateful and it's normal to forget what helped us.

We forget that was its presence that brought us so high in the climb.

So then, we throw them away. But now we start to fall, slowly.

It's like placing a sun chair on the vertical-sloped mountain and relax.

On the best situation, you'll slowly slip down. In the worst, you'll die with the fall.

** There Is No Button?
You can't stop in life.

It's always a sloped terrain, where there's only 2 states:
- Developing and Growing
Or
- Degenerating and Shrinking

Life is a game without pause or save.

When you stop playing, you start losing.

# Maybe this part changed too much the mood

** Ancient Wisdom
This is a teaching from ancient wisdom books such Bible.

One of the greatest personal values is the humidly.

These ancient wisdom books talk about it. Instruct us to maintain awareness of our inabilities and weaknesses, they premeditate this fall.

You can confirm, the great falls have the same causer: Prepotence and the blindness that arrogance brings.

In other words, *the lack of the _prudence_.*

When we have no insecurities anymore, we start to walk blindly, and falling in every hole or trap.


* So, Could I be a Jerk?
It's common insecure people be annoying and disrespectful.

Insecure people may try to take control of third situations, constantly seek validation, or overstep boundaries in their interactions, dismiss alternative viewpoints, or become defensive and critical when challenged.

Insecurity can also bring passive-aggressive behavior, envy, or attempts to undermine others in order to feel superior.

I think the right way to keep insecurities in control yet not annihilating them, is using them as motivation to improve, to keep you thirsty.

But never comparing your journey with the others' journey. You have your time, and the key is not stop.

A good insecurity makes you unsure if you did your best, and makes you improve and open to feedback.\\
The bad, makes you narcissistic and trying to control even others' emotions just to make you feel better.


* The "Good" News
But don't worry too much, insecurities are all around us.

And when you start to feel dangerously arrogant and prepotent, take the control back or you'll start to get blind.

Reflect on death, one of the greatest source of insecurities. The problem that humanity is incapable to solve. Never did and never will, but always tried.

Time is short. When you realize that, it will be too late.


* Outro
And keep in mind:
- *Everything* is not fine, there always something to improve.
- If you won't *do your best* in your present, you'll regret in your future.
- I have no sure of what I'm talking about.

Everyone has insecurities. Ones prefer to show, others tries to hide.

Just be cautious to not hide from yourself and get blind.
