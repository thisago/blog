Some time ago I had the unfortunate decision of contracting a accountant company to manage the legal state of my juridic person<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> because of it's lower price. But now I think the costs were just hidden in other ways.
</p>

<p>
I get very revolted with the imprudent use of LLMs. I think it's capable to bring high costs to the future, specially towards "freedom".
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org7e5d47a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7e5d47a">Misusing LLMs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7e5d47a">
<p>
The accountant company, one of the largest online at Brazil, have a recently built LLM assistant to reduce the support effort.
</p>

<p>
"Despite being on WhatsApp, this seems nice", I thought. Well, I was wrong.
</p>

<p>
After a deeper chat with the LLM about the overwhelming and complex nuances of Brazil's laws regarding managing a company, I got a response including my bank balance, based on the imported transactions.
</p>

<p>
This raised my guard, as I was naively assuming they was managing well my data.
</p>

<p>
I asked the LLM to tell me what information it received about me, and it listed almost everything the accountant company knows, some of the data includes:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>The company's unique ID</dt><dd>"CNPJ"</dd>
<dt>Full company name</dt><dd>Being a small company, it's likely to be your full name + some extra context. i.e., "John Doe Carpentry"</dd>
<dt>Account balance</dt><dd>Based on the importations</dd>
</dl>

<p>
And some non PII, which would supply all the context needs for a good support:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tax regime</li>
<li>Subscribed plan at the accountant platform</li>
</ul>

<p>
They simply doesn't takes caution on what they send to third-parties.
</p>

<h2 id="org81432e2">Misleading LLMs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org81432e2">
<p>
Then after asking and being answered by the assistant with a broad overview of what it knows about me, I started to ask about terms of privacy, where do I agreed to share my data to thirds and all stuff, and here the things started to get worse.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the LLM claimed with surety that no data is being sent by third-parties, considering the OpenAI not as a third-party.
</p>

<p>
Either being this behavior from the prompt or not, it seems the LLM have a great potential for deceiving us. They're basically agents with hidden intentions set by others, and with high politeness.

<h2 id="org94b3a69">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org94b3a69">
<p>
This post is not from good quality. I admit some of the other posts here was made with help of LLM reviews, but I starting to get disgusted with this and something meant to be a tool is becoming more likely to a plague, infesting everything, without options for the users.
</p>

<p>
I'm not against the technology itself, but mostly of integrated LLMs are through third-party services, making these services (i.e., OpenAI) a central of knowledge about intrinsic aspects of both technical and personal realities of us.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
I'd say the solution is something like self-hosting. Currently I use Copilot Pro, but I don't recommend and my next steps towards privacy would be:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Move out from GitHub to Codeberg. GitHub does likely the same with our data.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Despite still needing GitHub to work for others, I will soon move everything else to somewhere <i>less liberal</i> towards LLMs training and ingesting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let go of SaaS LLMs and self-host locally smaller models (or maybe rent GPUs when more power is needed)</li>
<li>Move out from this accountant company and locate some smaller accountant for more proximity.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I hope you found some use in this ugly words. I am happy to write this and I feel reclaiming the joy of doing things on my own, and also stopping to ask what LLM thinks about my thought as if it was a fair judge.
